========

Terminal workspaces for multitasking devs.

- Store your terminal layout in a text file, that you can commit into git and open the same on your other devices
- Re-open the same Claude code instances for different projects
- Work with your locally-developed software setups without long-lived Terminal instances

## Usage

```
$ mtm term.workspace
```
